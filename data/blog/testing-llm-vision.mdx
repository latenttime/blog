summary: Evaluating the visual aquity of Large Language Models (LLMs).
---

In order to get a handle on the capabilities of vision LLMs, we should develop
tests to measure their performance. This will help us as AI engineers to compare models for
vision usecases and to understand the limitations of our tools.

People benchmark their vison semi-regularly in an eyetest. A common metric is visual acuity (VA).
VA is a measure of the ability of the eye to distinguish shapes and the details of objects at a given distance.
