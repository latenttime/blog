Stephen's background is in science, software development, embedded systems, cyber security,
cloud computing and machine learning. He likes to work on interesting projects in the day job as a
prototype architect at Amazon Web Services as well as tinkering on pet projects in his own time.

He's interested in user interface and human technology interactions, motivated to build systems with
human sympathy as well as mechanical sympathy to minimise the gap between the user and the technology.
Stephen is passionate in how technology can be applied to help solve environmental and social problems.

Stephen's worked on projects with diverse data including images & video, timeseries sensor telemetry,
and large text corpora. He's interested in the intersection of these data types and how their representations could
be unified across modalities.
